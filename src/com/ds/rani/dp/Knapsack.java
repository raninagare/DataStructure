/**
 * 0-1 Knapsack Problem
 * Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in t
 * he knapsack. In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] which represent values and weights
 * associated with n items respectively. Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity,
 * find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W.
 * You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).
 *
 * Example:
 * Input:
 *      int val[] = new int[]{60, 100, 120};
 *      int wt[] = new int[]{10, 20, 30};
 *     int  targetW = 50;
 * Output:220

//So this is DP. their are 2 constraints first is targetW and second is value sum should be maximum so create 2D array
